# 🔁 Basic Control Structures and Pattern Programs in C++

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- 💻 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- 🌐 Online GDB Compiler / any standard C++ compiler

## 📚 Theory

This experiment explores various basic C++ constructs like loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `switch`), and pattern printing using nested loops. Each `case` in the program is treated as an independent logic problem that strengthens control flow understanding.

## 📐 Algorithms (Each Case)

### 1️⃣ Even Numbers (0–9)
🔹 Loop from 0 to 9  
🔹 Print number if divisible by 2  

### 2️⃣ Print "SIT" 5 Times
🔁 Loop runs 5 times  
🖨️ Print "SIT" each time  

### 3️⃣ Print 1 to 10, Skip 3 and 5
🔁 Loop from 1 to 10  
❌ Use `continue` to skip 3 and 5  

### 4️⃣ Right-Angled Triangle of Stars
⭐ Loop for rows  
⭐ Nested loop prints `*` increasing by row  

### 5️⃣ Inverted Triangle of Stars
🔻 Loop decreases rows  
⭐ Nested loop prints decreasing `*`  

### 6️⃣ Right-Aligned Triangle
🔹 Print spaces then stars  
📐 Creates a slanted triangle shape  

### 7️⃣ Centered Pyramid of Stars
📌 Use space and star logic  
⛰️ Forms symmetric star pyramid  

### 8️⃣ Number Triangle
🔢 Nested loops print numbers in triangle form  
➡️ Increment number each time  

### 9️⃣ Numbers 1 to 20
🔁 Simple loop from 1 to 20  
🖨️ Print each number  

### 🔟 Password Authenticator
🔐 Set password  
👤 Prompt user to enter it (max 3 attempts)  
✅ Grant access if correct  
❌ Deny if wrong after 3 tries

## ✅ Conclusion

This program enhances understanding of conditional and loop constructs in C++. It helps develop logic for decision-making, pattern printing, and simple authentication — building a strong base in structured programming. 🚀
